Cristina used has used a 10 plex TMT analysis in biological triplicate. The samples are as follows:

10 PLEX:
RPE Channel 1&2
Hela Channel 3&4
DLD1 2N Channel 5
DLD1 4N Channel 6
DLD1 3N clone 7 Channel 7
DLD1 3N clone 13 Channel 8
DLD1 3N clone 16 Channel 9
DLD1 more 4N clone 11 Channel 10

It would be great if you could compare all the channels versus RPE (channel 1&2), but also all channels versus the DLD 1 2N (channel 5). 


I guess this is pretty clear. I have searched the data with the old human database and the new short one. It would be interesting to run both and compare them. Here the links to Christinas TMT data:


Technical replicate 1 (human short, includes all biological triplicates (28b, 40, 41):

Please process the two technical independently and together. The idea is to find out how much a technical replicate increases coverage across 3 independent TMT replicate analyses. She also spiked in the protein standards to correct the ratios!
