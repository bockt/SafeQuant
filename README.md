Statistical Validation of differentially expressed proteins/peptides, 

SafeQuant allows for statistical validation of differentially expressed (DE) proteins/peptides across two or more sample conditions.
The analysis requires LC-MS runs from biological triplicate samples, per condition, aligned using Progenesis LC-MS
(NonLinear Dynamics).
