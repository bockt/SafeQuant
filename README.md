The SafeQuant Package includes methods for analysis of quantitative (LFQ,TMT,HRM) Proteomics data.

### Installation

#### 1) Install Dependencies

A) Install CRAN library dependencies (open R)

	R> install.packages(c("seqinr","gplots","corrplot","optparse","data.table","epiR","ggplot2","magrittr","dplyr","ggrepel"))

B) Install BioConductor library dependencies (open R)

	R> source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
	R> biocLite(c("limma","Biobase","pcaMethods","impute","GO.db","UniProt.ws","affy"))

#### 2) Install SafeQuant from sources

**Option 1, install "master branch" using "devtools"**

Make sure you have a working development environment.

**Windows**: Install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

**Mac**: Install Xcode from the Mac App Store.

**Linux**: Install a compiler and various development libraries (details vary across different flavors of Linux).

    R> install.packages("devtools")
    R> library(devtools)
    R> install_github("eahrne/SafeQuant")
    
**Option 2, install latest [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SafeQuant) version**

	R> install.packages("SafeQuant")

#### 3) Running safeQuant.R 

A) locate file safeQuant.R (C:\Users\ahrnee-adm\Downloads\SafeQuant\exec\safeQuant.R ) 
This is the SafeQuant main script. Copy it to an appropriate directory, e.g. c:\Program Files\SafeQuant\
	
B) open terminal
To display help options

	> Rscript "c:\Program Files\SafeQuant\safeQuant.R" -h
To run (with minimal arguments)

	> Rscript "c:\Program Files\SafeQuant\safeQuant.R" -i "c:\Program Files\SafeQuant\testData\peptide_measurement.csv" -o "c:\Program Files\SafeQuant\out"

##### Progenesis

**Input file:** "Peptide Measurement" .CSV file

- File -> Export Peptide Measurements.  This option is available once you have reached the "Resolve Conflicts" Step in Progenesis QI
- When choosing properties to be included in the exported file check the "Grouped accessions (for this sequence)" check box.

##### Scaffold (TMT, experimental support)

**Input file:** "Raw Export" .XLS

Note that the experimental design needs to be specified (column numbers refer to listing order in .txt).
 
	> Rscript "c:\Program Files\SafeQuant\safeQuant.R"  -i ../../SafeQuantTestData/TMT_10-Plex_Scaffold_Raw_Export_Example.xls --EX 1,2,3,4,5:6,7,8,9,10

##### MaxQuant (experimental support)

**Input file:** proteinGroups.txt

Note that the experimental design needs to be specified (column numbers refer to listing order in .txt).
 
	> Rscript "c:\Program Files\SafeQuant\safeQuant.R"  -i ../../SafeQuantTestData/misc/maxQuant/proteinGroups.txt --EX 1,2,3:6,7,8 

#### Basic functionality of the safeQuant.R script

1. **Data Normalization**
	* LFQ
		* Global data normalization by equalizing the total MS1 peak areas  across all LC/MS runs.
	* Isobaric Labeling experiments (TMT or iTRAQ)
		* Global data normalization by equalizing the total reporter ion intensities across all reporter ion channels.
2. **Ratio Calculation**
	* LFQ
		* Summation of MS1 peak areas per peptide/protein and LC-MS/MS run, followed by calculation of peptide/protein abundance ratios. 
	* Isobaric Labeling experiments (TMT or iTRAQ)
		* Summation of reporter ion intensities per peptide/protein and LC-MS/MS run, followed by calculation of peptide/protein abundance ratios. 
3. **Statistical testing for differential abundances**
	* The summarized peptide/protein expression values are used for statistical testing of between condition differentially abundant peptides/proteins. Here, empirical Bayes moderated t-tests is applied, as implemented in the R/Bioconductor limma package (Smyth, 2004). The resulting per protein and condition comparison p-values are subsequently adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.
